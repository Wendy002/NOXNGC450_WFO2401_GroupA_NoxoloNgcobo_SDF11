## **Cache Bank Landing Page**

### Overview
In this project, I created a landing page for cache bank focusing on responsive web design using html, css, tailwind css and some Javascript. 
This involved applying various tailwind css techniques to achieve responsive, visually appealing design that is compatible with different screen-sizes.

### Reflections

#### Areas of Mastery

- **Tailwind css  Layout Techniques**:  I feel confident using utility classes that apply flexbox or grid properties. 
I find using this framework to be faster then writing traditional css.
- **Responsive Design**: My approach was mobile first design and  I achieved responsive design by using utility classes 
for media queries such as sm -for small screens to 2xl for desktop view.
- **Styling Elements**: I was able to style the navigation bar, created cards for features, 
applied hover effect on buttons, cards amd links.
- **Use of Javascript**: Used Javascript to add interactivity on the Navigation bar , 
this enables the user to be able to view or hide menu in mobile view.

#### Challenges Faced

- **Responsive Design for Smaller Screens**: Deciding between flexbox and grid can be tricky at times, 
this was challenging but got to understand why sometimes one layout works better than the other 
given different elements amd structure of each section.
- **Styling the hero section get-started section**: It was challenging to place the img element next to text content. 
The full width was difficult to style as compared to using  specified max-width.

#### Areas for Improvement

- **Advanced CSS Properties**: The learning doesn't stop, I still want to learn more useful css properties, master applying layouts.
- **Javascript mastery**: This site still has more room for add ons, 
like create event listeners for the sign up button that directs you to a user sign up page
- **Code Optimization**:  Code refactoring, use semantic html
- **Tailwind css darkmode and personalised config file**: Learn more on create accessible webpages that offer dark mode and easy navigation of the pages

#### Overall Learning Experience

  This was a great challenge especially because I threw myself in the deep end and didn't rely on lectures given to us. 
  This helped retain most of the content I was consuming.
